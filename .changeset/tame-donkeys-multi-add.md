`add` now accepts multiple component names (`sanring add button dialog`) and automatically installs a component's `componentDeps` (e.g. `sanring add tag` also adds `badge`), labeling auto-added components `(dependency)` in the output. Shared files and peer dependencies are deduped and installed once across the whole batch. Single-component usage is unaffected.

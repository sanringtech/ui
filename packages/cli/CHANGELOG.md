# @sanring/cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 20c768d: Registry now includes `aspect-ratio` and `textarea` components (`sanring add aspect-ratio`, `sanring add textarea`). `@sanring/ui`'s `input` directive no longer targets `<textarea>` — use the new `sanringTextarea` directive instead when re-copying the `input` component.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6cc0001: `add` now accepts multiple component names (`sanring add button dialog`) and automatically installs a component's `componentDeps` (e.g. `sanring add tag` also adds `badge`), labeling auto-added components `(dependency)` in the output. Shared files and peer dependencies are deduped and installed once across the whole batch. Single-component usage is unaffected.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5ffb8f9: Fix `packages/cli/registry` (bundled with the published package) silently drifting from the root `registry/` source of truth. `pnpm build` now runs a `sync-registry` step that mirrors root `registry/` into the package and fails the build if `registry.json` references a file that doesn't exist, so a stale/broken registry can no longer ship unnoticed.

  Also fix the version-pinned remote registry fallback (used when the bundled registry is missing, e.g. before a first build): it referenced a `v<version>` git tag and `packages/cli/registry`, neither of which ever existed — Changesets tags releases as `<package-name>@<version>`, and `packages/cli/registry` is gitignored so it's never committed. The fallback now points at the correct tag (URL-encoded `refs/tags/@sanring/cli@<version>`) and the repo-root `registry/` directory, and was verified end-to-end against the real GitHub repo.

  Adds unit tests for package-manager detection, config read/write, and registry source-resolution priority (local path → URL → bundled registry → remote fallback).

# @sanring/cli

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 5ffb8f9: Fix `packages/cli/registry` (bundled with the published package) silently drifting from the root `registry/` source of truth. `pnpm build` now runs a `sync-registry` step that mirrors root `registry/` into the package and fails the build if `registry.json` references a file that doesn't exist, so a stale/broken registry can no longer ship unnoticed.

  Also fix the version-pinned remote registry fallback (used when the bundled registry is missing, e.g. before a first build): it referenced a `v<version>` git tag and `packages/cli/registry`, neither of which ever existed — Changesets tags releases as `<package-name>@<version>`, and `packages/cli/registry` is gitignored so it's never committed. The fallback now points at the correct tag (URL-encoded `refs/tags/@sanring/cli@<version>`) and the repo-root `registry/` directory, and was verified end-to-end against the real GitHub repo.

  Adds unit tests for package-manager detection, config read/write, and registry source-resolution priority (local path → URL → bundled registry → remote fallback).
